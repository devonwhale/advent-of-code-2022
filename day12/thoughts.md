So the good news is that I remembered that A* was a pathfinding algorithm from when I did that sort of thing back at university. The bad news is that I forgot it isn't guaranteed to find the shortest path, which meant I spent a long time debugging it wondering why it was giving me an answer that was too big when I'm fairly certain it was working fine. Still, that'll teach me to trust my memory.
